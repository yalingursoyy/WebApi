# WebApi

This is an experimental project for learning and gaining some experience. If you notice any errors, or have some suggestions please let me know. I realize that this still needs a lot of work and has a lot of room for improvement.

This is a .NET 6 web application using unit of work and repository pattern. I will try to add JWT Authentication for user logins and restrictions.
